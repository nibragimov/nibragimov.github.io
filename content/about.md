Welcome to my blog! Here I will write about what I have learned
and found interesting. Hope you will enjoy it.
### About me
Hi! I am Nodir. I love solving problems and creating things on computer.

My favourite editor is VSCode, though JetBrains IDEs are also cool. I am mostly using Linux environments for development and I love Linux terminal. 

Currently, my interests in CS/SE are ~~backend development~~, systems programming, automation tools.

I am currently working on Bachelor thesis, which will be available on GitHub upon completion.
